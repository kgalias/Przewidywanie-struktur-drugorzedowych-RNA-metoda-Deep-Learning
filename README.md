# protein-2d-prediction
Project for the course "Bioinformatyka" @ WMiI UJ 2016/2017. It utilizes a few simple neural networks (via [keras](https://keras.io/
)) in the problem of [protein secondary structure prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction#Secondary_structure).

To run, do ```python prot_2d.py```.
